# Introduction

The goal of this document is to demonstrate how easy it is to generate
beautiful documents with just a little knowledge of
[Markdown][wikipedia_markdown] and a tool called [Pandoc][pandoc_homepage]. I
want to debunk the myth that **Docs as Code** (or **DaC** for short) is ...

- ... hard to learn.
- ... only used to document software projects.
- ... only suitable for programmers and/or engineers.
- ... would require you to learn a lot of [LaTeX][wikipedia_latex].


Always remember:

> Documents as Code is easy!

This document is not supposed to do so by itself. It is not some guide or
tutorial. The purpose of this document is to have something to work with to
demonstrate different aspects of the **DaC** approach to generate nice looking
documents. I set up a [website][schuam_dac] that explains everything and this
document will be used in the explanation.

It is also not a manual for Pandoc as this already exists
[online][pandoc_user_guide] or a Markdown guide, because there are already
plenty of resources available online that explain the Markdown syntax, e.g.
[this one][markdown_guide].

My plan is to set up a demonstration that is split into four levels (from
*beginner* to *pro*). The higher the level the better the generated document
will look. Nevertheless, only the highest two levels will require any
[LaTeX][wikipedia_latex] knowledge. But even at the second level, the document
will already look really professional and most likely way better than anything
you create with Word.

1. **Beginner**:

   Let's start simple. Just use a plain Markdown file and the simplest form of
   the `pandoc` command to build the output PDF file: no additional
   options/parameters, just the bare minimum.

   Assuming the source Markdown file is called `solution_beginner.md`, the
   following command renders the PDF output file `solution_beginner.pdf`:
   `pandoc -o solution_beginner.pdf solution_beginner.md`

1. **Intermediate**:

   Here we ...

    - add a first additional option to the `pandoc` command. This option
      enumerates the sections.
    - add some front matter with additional information about the document.
    - add some additional metadata to configure the styling of the output. This
      drastically improves the look of the output.

   The output are three consecutively better looking output files.

1. **Advanced**:

   This is the first time, a little bit of [LaTeX][wikipedia_latex] syntax is
   used to further improve the look of the PDF file. But don't worry, it is
   very simple and everything is explained. After that you should be able to
   make changes in the given example to tweak the look further to your liking.

   Pandoc can be extended by the use of filters. I show how to use one of them
   as an example. This will for instance allow us to reference images (see the
   [Figures section](#figures) or the [Inline Image
   section](#sec:inline-images)). See [chapter @sec:inline-images].

   The **advanced** level is split into two steps (two output files).

1. **Pro**:

   For the **Pro** level I figured it is time to write a little LaTeX template
   for Pandoc to get the maximum out of it.


All right let's get started. The following chapters won't necessarily contain
meaningful content. Their main purpose is to demonstrate different
possibilities for formatting and other features.

# Images

Images can either be added as figures or inline. When added as a figure, a
caption will be added that include the current number of the figure which is
automatically increase with every figure. When added inline, all that is added
is an image, nothing else.


## Figures

Figures are *floating* objects in [LaTeX][wikipedia_latex]. Since
[Pandoc][pandoc_homepage] used LaTeX in the background, figures might not
appear where you expect them to appear. While this might be annoying in the
beginning, this is actually a feature. Also you should always refer to an
included figure somewhere in the text. If you don't do that, you might as well
just not add the figure.

[Figure @fig:example] shows a section on the way between Santiago de Chile and
Mendoza in Argentina.

![Sample Figure](img/image.jpg){#fig:example}


## Inline Images

With inline images, you can for example place two images next to each other:

![Sample Figure](img/image.jpg){width=50%} ![Sample Figure](img/image.jpg){width=50%}


# Math

Something that is often needed is math expressions/equations/formulas. Just
like images math can be inserted inline or as separate entities.

## Inline Math

One of the most famous equations of all time is probably $E =
mc^2$.[^footnote_mass_energy]


## Equations

Writing the equation from the previous section inline, like I did, doesn't
really do it justice. Therefore it is also possible to render it a little more
noticeable like this:

$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq:mass_energy}

[Equation @eq:mass_energy] looks way better than the inline version doesn't
it?[^footnote_confirmation]

If you want, you can use superscripts and subscripts in normal text as well.
Here are two examples: H~2~O and 2^10^.

By the way, Albert Einstein published a bunch of papers. One is called "Zur
Elektrodynamik bewegter KÃ¶rper" [see @einstein1905electrodynamik, pp. 42].

[^footnote_mass_energy]: According to [Wikipedia][wikipedia_mass_energy]
    Einstein was the first one to propose the equivalence of mass and energy.
[^footnote_confirmation]: Of course it does. Who questioned it?

# Tables

Last but not least, let's add a table to the document. This can be done in
multiple ways. Please read [Pandoc's User Guide][pandoc_user_guide] for more
information. I will just add one table that uses the most complicated type. I
wanted to use that type to demonstrate that you can create pretty complicated
tables with cells that span multiple rows and/or columns. Admittedly the
Markdown code is a little bit cumbersome, but if you don't need all the
features shown here, there are simpler table types.

: Table Example {#tbl:example_table}

+---------------+---------------+------------+
| Fruit                         | Prize      |
+:==============+:=============:+===========:+
| Apple         |  green \      | 1.00       |
|               |  round \      |            |
|               +---------------+------------+
|               |  red \        | 1.25       |
|               |  round \      |            |
+---------------+---------------+------------+
| Bananas       |  yellow \     | 0.50       |
|               |  curved       |            |
+===============+===============+============+
| Total         |               | 2.75       |
+===============+===============+============+

To add [table @tbl:example_table], I had to add the following to the Markdown
source file:

```markdown {.numberLines}
: Table Example

+---------------+---------------+------------+
| Fruit                         | Prize      |

|               |  round \      |            |
|               +---------------+------------+
|               |  red \        | 1.25       |
|               |  round \      |            |
+---------------+---------------+------------+
| Bananas       |  yellow \     | 0.50       |
|               |  curved       |            |
+===============+===============+============+
| Total         |               | 2.75       |
+===============+===============+============+
```
